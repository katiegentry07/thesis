Katie thrives on bringing community resources together to better address homelessness from a human-centered perspective. What began as a passion for helping others when she was just 14 turned into a career she least expected. Born and raised in Portland, Oregon, she decided to venture out into the world to attend college in Colorado. She graduated from the University of Denver with a bachelor's degree in Chemistry and minors in Psychology, Leadership Studies, and Math, but decided to move to Phoenix to accept an AmeriCorps VISTA position focusing on homelessness and Veteran work. Her work for Mayor Stanton quickly brought her back to her love for homelessness. She has since worked as a Council Aide for Mayor Stanton, Research & Policy Coordinator for the Arizona Housing Coalition, and currently works for the City of Chandler as the Community Development Coordinator. Katie decided to pursue her Master’s Degree in Program Evaluation & Data Analytics to further bring the right resources to the right people at the right time. Katie enjoys traveling, hiking, and exploring coffee shops when she’s not outreaching to individuals experiencing homelessness.

- Produce static and interactive visualizations that showcase the stories embedded within the clients data.
- Configure and maintain source code repositories using Git.
- Use branching to create, test, and push new features to master branch.
- Identify equivalent individuals, using both deterministic and probabilistic record linkage methods, in administrative datasets using R.
- Developing a Shiny app with colleague that aggregates census tract information up to the Chicago community area level.
- Rely on passion for self-learning to teach myself new packages, methods, and tools needed to answer research questions.
- Constantly seeking feedback to improve my ability to communicate technical insights to both technical and non-technical team members.
