Shown throughout the analysis, the report analyzes gentrification and whether or not Community Land Trusts slow gentrification in Chandler, Arizona. The report determines if a neighborhood is eligible for gentrification based on median income rates. The variables used to determine if a neighborhood had not gentrified was less educated individuals, more poverty, more family poverty, more renters, and more minorities. After analyzing neighborhoods, an analysis determined which neighborhoods were candidates for gentrification and which did not gentrify from 2000 to 2010. 

After determining which neighborhoods had not gentrified, the Community Land Trust data could be overlayed. Due to the nature of the program and the purchasing of homes scattered throughout the city, the researcher was comparing apples and oranges because not all neighborhoods that did not gentrify contained Community Land Trust homes and not all Community Land Trust home tracts were eligible for gentrification. When comparing tracts that did not gentrify that contained Community Land Trust homes and tracts that did not contain Community Land Trust homes, the percentage of uneducated individuals, poverty rate, family poverty rate, and proportion of minorities stayed relatively similar. However, the median home value increase and the median home value growth was signficantly lower in tracts that contained Community Land Trust homes verses those that did not. The other notable difference was the tracts that contained Community Land Trust homes had half of the increased rate of renters than those that did not. These statistics indicate that even though homes are appreciating at a slower rate, tracts that contain Community Land Trust homes are often homeowners and thus slowing the rate of gentrification in these neighborhoods compared to tracts without Community Land Trust homes.
