### Data Sources

All of the data used for the analysis comes from the Census Longitudinal Tabulated Database. This database encompasses Census Data from 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010 in both the American Community Survey short sample form and the decennial census data. 

### Median Home Value

Median Home Value is defined as the middle of home prices. Data scientists use median home value as a way to show home value change over time. Adjusted for inflation across time, median home value can be a main variable in determining gentrification and overall wealth in a census tract or area. Median Home Value is also less affected or skewed than average price as outliers would have minimal effect on the median. In combination with other variables, median home value allows for the analysis of gentrification. 

### Neighborhood Health Metrics

Neighborhood Health measures how successful a neighborhood is based on a variety of factors which often lead to less gentrification. A neighborhood that has gentrified often includes higher education levels, less poverty, less family poverty, less renters, and less minorities present. These attributes together result in a moderate to higher income individual that is educated and employed, often owning a home. On the contrary, a neighborhood that has not gentrified often has lower education levels, more poverty and family poverty, more renters, and more minorities present representing the social and economic neighborhood that continues to be present.
