## Metrics

There are many different metrics used to define neighborhood change and therefore, a definition is needed to determine how Group 1 for this project defined the data. 

### Data Sources

All of the data used for the analysis comes from the Census Longitudinal Tabulated Database. This database encompasses Census Data from 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010 in both the American Community Survey short sample form and the decennial census data. 

### Median Home Value

Median Home Value is defined as the middle of home prices. Data scientists use median home value as a way to show home value change over time. Adjusted for inflation across time, median home value can be a main variable in determining gentrification and overall wealth in a census tract or area. Median Home Value is also less affected or skewed than average price as outliers would have minimal effect on the median. In combination with other variables, median home value allows for the analysis of gentrification. 

### Neighborhood Health

Neighborhood Health measures how successful a neighborhood is based on a variety of factors. Positive or negative attributes can determine the health of the neighborhood. A healthy neighborhood would include these positive attributes. Our research found that neighborhoods with higher education levels, less unemployment, less poverty, less renters, and more money resulted in a greater neighborhood health and was more gentrified. These attributes together result in a moderate to higher income individual that is educated and employed, often owning a home. 

### Gentrification

Gentrification is the process of changing a neighborhood by creating more affluent neighborhoods. The process often increases the value of a neighborhood by developing or changing housing, improving resources that are available in the neighborhood, and investing more money and economic strength into the neighborhood. The benefits of gentrification often include increased infrastructure, increased economic development, lower crime rates, and overall improved housing. However, the downsides of gentrification include changing the economic make-up of a neighborhood which often includes the racial and ethnic make-up, displacement of individuals or families, and the lack of affordability that gentrification initiates. We use two different variables to identify neighborhoods that are able to gentrify. These include poverty at a higher than normal rate in urban cities and median income for metros are less than the normal rate.
