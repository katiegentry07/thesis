### New Market Tax Credit

The New Market Tax Credit (NMTC) was created in 2000 to bring private investment into low-income communities through Community Development Entities. A Community Development Entity (CDE) is a corporation or partnership that is providing loans, investments, or financial counseling to communities that are low income. The recipients of these loans or investments are qualified active low-income community businesses which can be for-profit or non-profit. There is not a requirement for the purpose of these businesses which can range from retail to manufacturing, community facilities such as health services or museums to housing. The most common uses include retail, manufacturing or industrial, and mixed use space. 

The private investors of NMTC are given credit as a reduction in federal tax liability at a rate of 39% of the investment amount over a 7 year period for investing in these CDEs. The tax credits can be claimed at 5% of the investment for the first three years and 6% of the investment over the following 4 years. The program has given nearly $23 billion in tax credits and supported more than 4,800 projects. On average, the program gives about $1.3 billion per year. Although approximately 43% of census tracts qualify, only 4% of those tracts have received projects. 

### Low Income Housing Tax Credit

The Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program was created in 1986 as an indirect subsidy to assist in the construction and rehabilitation of affordable housing. The credit gives a match reduction in federal tax liability to non-profit and private developers to provide more housing for individuals who are low income. There are two different types of LIHTC which provide two different subsidies of tax credit. The 30 percent subsidy provides an automatic 4 percent tax credit to cover new construction with other additional subsidies or the acquisition cost of an existing building. The 70 percent subsidy provides an automatic 9 percent tax credit to support new construction but does not allow other federal subsidies. The tax credit is claimed over 10 years once the project is built and rented. 

The tax credit requires certain eligibility such as keeping the rent at a certain level and restricting who the units can be rented to for 30 years. However, the recipient of the LIHTC has flexibility in meeting the income test for residents. Developers have their choice of 3 options:
1) 20 percent of the units occupied by residents with 50 percent or below area median income
2) 40 percent of the units occupied by residents with 60 percent or below area median income, 3) 40 percent of the units occupied by residents averaging 60 percent or below area median income and no units occupied by residents with 80 percent or greater area median income. 

Although the tax credit is given at the federal level, the subsidy is administered by state agencies through a Qualified Allocation Plan. The state agency oversees the program and distributes the funding to the investors. They are also responsible for ensuring compliance with the tax credit requirements. The program costs about $9 billion per year and results in approximately 110,000 affordable rental units built each year. Since beginning, approximately 2 million units have been built. 

Without the incentive, often affordable housing would not be built as there is not enough profit to cover the expenses of the projects. 

### Data Sources
