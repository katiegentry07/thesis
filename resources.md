## Data Resources
 
#### [Logitudinal Tract Data Base](https://s4.ad.brown.edu/projects/diversity/Researcher/Bridging.htm)

The Logitudinal Tract Data Base (LTDB) provides public-use tools to create estimates within 2010 tract boundaries for any tract-level data (from the census or other sources) that are available for prior years as early as 1970. We also provide a Backwards LTDB in which data provided in 2010 tract boundaries can be estimated within 2000 boundaries. 

#### [LTDB Codebook](/files/LTBD-codebook.pdf)
