This report was commissioned to determine if neighborhoods targeted by two federal programs, Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) and New Market Tax Credit (NMTC) achieve greater revitalization than if the federal programs were not implemented. 

The LIHTC program was created in 1986 as an indirect subsidy to assist in the construction and rehabilitation of affordable housing. The credit gives a match reduction in federal tax liability to non-profit and private developers to provide more housing for individuals who are low income. The incentive requires eligibility such as keeping the rent at a certain level and restricting who the units can be rented to for at least 30 years. Without the incentive, often affordable housing would not be built as there is not enough profit to cover the expenses of the projects. 

The NMTC was created in 2000 to bring private investment into low-income communities through Community Development Entities. A Community Development Entity (CDE) is a corporation or partnership that is providing loans, investments, or financial counseling to communities that are low income. The private investors are given credit as a reduction in federal tax liability at a rate of 39% of the investment amount over a 7 year period for investing in these CDEs. 

The report utilizes data from the Census Longitudinal Tabulated Database. This database encompasses data from 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010 in both the sample and full datasets. In addition, the report utilizes data from the New Market Tax Credit Summary Report which includes the New Market Tax Credit Public Data from 2003 to 2017 and the Low Income Housing Tax Credit database which includes data from 1987 to 2017. To the best of our knowledge, the information in the databases are accurate and reliable as of the date of publication.

Utilizing the databases, the team maneuvered the data to obtain the necessary analysis. After the data was loaded and merged appropriately, the descriptive analysis of neighborhood change was performed. The team began by limiting the data to urban cities and calculating a variety of variables used for analysis. These variables were median home value change and neighborhood metrics predicting gentrification including education level, poverty rate, unemployment rate, proportion of renters, and median income. After the variables were created, the demographics and health metrics could be summarized and further displayed. In addition, the team produced mapping of the variables. 

After neighborhood change was presented, the team moved to evaluating the use of tax credits. The descriptive statistics analyzes the dollars given out and the characteristics of neighborhoods that received them versus those that did not utilizing summary statistics and mapping. Lastly, the team used difference-in-difference modeling to show how tax credits impacted or did not impact the neighborhoods that gentrified. 

Overall, the team showed that tax credits had some impact on gentrification. Initially, median home values were lower in NMTC and LIHTC tracts than non-NMTC and non-LIHTC tracts. However, the median home value growth was higher in NMTC tracts and about the same in LIHTC tracts therefore showing that New Market Tax Credits had a moderate effect on gentrification and Low Income Housing Tax Credits had minimal effect. Using predictive analysis for self-employment, unemployment, and metro median pay, there was minimal effect on gentrification. The definition of gentrification can change based on the viewer and that definition determines the impact of the tax credit program and if they were successful.

The code presented is a basis to determine which census tract variables define gentrification and can be changed or manipulated based on the definition of gentrification. The flexible code allows for a reproducible data process by changing the census tract variables. Using the data wrangling folder and the steps in analysis, variables can be changed and incorporated in a variety of ways therefore determining a different success of the tax credit program.
